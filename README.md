CrisPix is an elegant Ultra-HD photo bin alternative, built to provide a medium for users, stakeholders and companies around the world to connect and collaborate with professional photographers and their portfolio of work. See the world through others.

## Features

1. See a collage of photos so that I can potentially find a new interest.
2. I can favorite pictures I like, so that I can access them later.
3. I can search from the collage of photos to find certain photos based on keyword.
4. I can view the 30 most popular photos of the day.
5. I can view an individual photo to see a larger version of it and get more information on the creator/photographer who took the photo.
6. I can download the full, UHD version of the photo.

## Running the Project

1. Download the files, which when unzipped will provide you a folder of the files.
2. Open this folder in your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice. Some options include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or a Code/text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom.
3. In the provided terminal within the IDE (If you're using sublime text or Atom, ensure to open a separate terminal and change to the project directory, i.e. `cd ~/Downloads/CrisPix-Final` or `cd C:\Users\<Your Username>\Downloads\CrisPix-Final`
4. Ensure you have nodejs and NPM installed on your computer before proceeding.
5. To install the required dependencies to run the application, change to the `app` directory (`cd C:\Users\<Your 
Username>\Downloads\CrisPix-Final\app or ~/Downloads/CrisPix-Final/app`), run the command `npm install` ; This is 
downloading 
all the required dependencies by parsing through the package.json file. **Note: these files should already be pre-installed, based on how we presented this project. But if it isn't, run `npm install` in the terminal.`
6. Repeat step 5 for the `server` directory.
7. Once completed, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser of choice.

## Currently in the works / not functional

1. Favorited photos do not save upon refresh / closing and reopening of the web browser.
2. Unit tests did not make it to the PoC, but E2E tests were.
